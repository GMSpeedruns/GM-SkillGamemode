# TODO
- Finish timer
- Improve admin interface (make zone placement intuitive)
- Place correct settings in `bhop.txt` and `surf.txt`
- Make something to sync VarNet (CRC32 of entire table)
- Check platform syncing and if that works (`maps/bhop.lua`)
- Make extensions integratable to the admin panel
- Some form of whitelist possiblities (as extension, enablable)
- Check if extensions on the client need to be checked
- Make a 'checkpoint' system which allows players to set their own checkpoints remembering their # jumps and their velocity, with the option to reset them if slower
- RTV system where you can still nominate when the vote starts (no nominations needed!)

# THINKING
- Modes and styles: load them in from folder. Maybe allow some modes to be stackable (practice, low gravity). And should things like scroll/auto be a mode or a style.
- For playing bonus, you do !b, then !r will work normally. To leave bonus, also type !b
