If the server abruptly crashes when switching to a given map, make sure the corresponding .nav file is present in the `garrysmod/maps` folder.
The maps listed in this directory are already known to crash without a correct .nav file.
If there is a map crashing which is not in the list yet, simply copy an existing .nav file and rename it to match with the crashing map.
